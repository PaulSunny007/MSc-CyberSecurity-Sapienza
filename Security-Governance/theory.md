## Lesson 1 - Introduction

A generic enterprise in order to accomplish its mission it will design some processes to be carried out.  
These processes involves both **humans**, **relationships** between them and **IT infrastructures**.  
There are different definitions of governance:  
- “Governance is all of the processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, a
market or a network, over a social system (family, tribe, formal or informal organization, a
territory or across territories) and whether through the laws, norms, power or language of an
organized society.” (Mark Bevir)
- “The Governance is the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors
involved in a collective problem that lead to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of
social norms and institutions.” (Marc Hufty)
