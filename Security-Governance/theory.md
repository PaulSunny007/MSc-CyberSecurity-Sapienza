# Security Governance - Theory

## Lesson 1 - Introduction

A generic enterprise in order to accomplish its mission it will design some processes to be carried out.  
These processes involves both **humans**, **relationships** between them and **IT infrastructures**.  
There are different definitions of governance:  
- “Governance is all of the processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, a
market or a network, over a social system (family, tribe, formal or informal organization, a
territory or across territories) and whether through the laws, norms, power or language of an
organized society.” (Mark Bevir)
- “The Governance is the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors
involved in a collective problem that lead to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of
social norms and institutions.” (Marc Hufty)

We have a strict definition of *Enterprise Governance*: "Enterprise governance is the structure and relationships that control, direct, or regulate the performance of an enterprise [and its] projects, portfolios, infrastructure, and processes." (Wilson, W. L., 2009, Conceptual Model for Enterprise Governance, Ground System Architectures Workshop).  
We can divide E.G. into Corporate Governance and Business Governance:  
- Corporate governance is the system of rules, practices and processes by which a firm is directed and controlled. ( Compliance Processes)
- Business Governance is a set of policies and business processes that set the way that the organisation’s business is run. (Performance Processes)

We are interested in the first one. (*Corporate Governance*)  

Every governance system use the **direct/control loop**.
