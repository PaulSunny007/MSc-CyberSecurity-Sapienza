Two routers connecting via wan and with two lans. Setup a tunnel between the two lans.
Setup the two lans to have the following IPv4 scheme:
- lanA: 192.168.1.0/24 (r1 has .1)
- lanB: 192.168.2.0/24 (r2 has .1)
- r1 and r2 have 100.60.10.1/16 and 100.60.10.2/16 respectively

Setup the ip tunnel between r1 and r2 and enable the use of the tunnel
