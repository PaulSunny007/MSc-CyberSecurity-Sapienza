The *exercises* folder contains stupid programs I wrote to train myself with c++.  
To compile the programs you can use `make all` or `make build`.
To clear the folder `make clean`.

- Linux: `g++ -std=c++0x example.cpp -o example_program`
- Windows: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp
