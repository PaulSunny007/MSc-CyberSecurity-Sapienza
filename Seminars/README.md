# Cybersecurity Seminars

This is not a traditional course but a subsidiary formative activity (called AAF - 6 CFU). In Italy, within the master's degree course, students are expected to attend one AAF, in addition to traditional courses. This AAF elaborates on what was previously learned in the master's degree course in Cybersecurity through guest lectures. In particular, it comments on the threats, vulnerabilities, and cyber risks that emerge from the latest attacks reported and illustrates success stories to protect data and prevent network or computer systems violations. Some of the seminars will explicitly cover the content of professional ethics.

The objective of the course is for students to understand the topics discussed in the seminars by applying them to a real-world case. They will be asked to use their knowledge to imagine a company selling an innovative product or service related to the topics discussed in class.
