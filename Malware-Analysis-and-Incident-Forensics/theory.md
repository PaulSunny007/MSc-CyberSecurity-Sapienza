# Malware Analysis and Incident Forensics - Theory

## Lesson 1 - Introduction

General news about malware-based attacks:
- [Yahoo 'state' hackers stole data from 500 million users](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37447016)
- [Brian Krebs site hit with 665 Gbps DDoS attack; Largest Internet has ever seen](https://www.hackread.com/brian-krebs-website-665-gbps-ddos-attack/)
- [The Equifax data breach exposes extremely
sensitive data from 143 million consumers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-07/equifax-says-cyber-intrusion-affected-143-million-customers)

The data breach market is ourishing. Black markets provide advanced tools for data search. Prices are extremely variable depending on the specific product.

The topic of this course revolves around *Cyber Security*  
“preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information in the Cyberspace” (ISO-27000)  
Cyberspace is “the complex environment resulting from the interaction of people, software and services on the Internet by means of technology devices and networks connected to it, which does not exist in any physical form” (NIST)

The **Attack Killchain** is list made of 8 points explaining the anatomy of a malware:  
- Reconnaissance
- Weaponization
- Delivery
- Exploitation
- Persistence
- Callback
- Data exfiltration
- Lateral spread

In this course we will go deep in the last 4 points.

Expected beaviours:
- Persistence
    - The malware installs itself in the system
    - It performs actions to guarantee its survivability to reboots, inspections, etc.
    - Often modifies the OS configuration
    - Changes are hidden
- Uniqueness
    - Malware is often incompatible with itself
    - Multiple concurrent executions are meaningless
      - Or sometimes dangerous for the malware itself
      - Think about two ransomware instances competing for the same resources
    - Checks at startup guarantee te execution of a single copy
